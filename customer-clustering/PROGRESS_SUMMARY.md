# Customer Clustering Project: Progress Summary

## Recent Updates and Fixes

### Notebook Fixes

We've successfully fixed the remaining issues in the `create_clusters.ipynb` notebook:

1. **Fixed VIF Analysis**:
   - Properly handled missing values, NaN, and infinite values in feature matrices
   - Added proper error handling for feature importance calculation
   - Implemented clean visualization of feature variance and importance

2. **Fixed Cluster Analysis**:
   - Resolved index alignment issues between different dataframes
   - Fixed type mismatch issues in merge operations
   - Enhanced export of cluster results and summaries

3. **Successfully Executed Notebook**:
   - All cells up through the cluster analysis are now executing correctly
   - Properly generated and exported clustering results, summaries, and reports
   - Added proper data quality checks and feature selection steps

### Database Management

We've created a comprehensive database cleanup utility to help manage the database:

1. **Cleanup Script (`cleanup_temp_tables.py`)**:
   - Identifies and lists temporary and backup tables
   - Provides options for dry run, backup, or full cleanup
   - Includes error handling for database access issues
   - Backs up core tables before removing any data

2. **Documentation**:
   - Added detailed instructions for database cleanup in `DATABASE_CLEANUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Provided guidance on handling locked database issues
   - Documented core tables and their purposes

## Current State and Results

### Database Status

- All layers (bronze, silver, gold) have 15,008 unique customers
- No duplicate customers found in any layer
- Feature engineering complete with proper calculation of diversity scores
- All required backup tables are in place

### Clustering Results

- Successfully implemented enhanced denoising using multiple techniques:
  - Isolation Forest for outlier detection
  - Feature importance ranking
  - Variance analysis and correlation handling
  
- Final clustering achieved with:
  - 2 distinct clusters identified as optimal number
  - Clear separation between clusters with distinctive features
  - Comprehensive cluster profiles with key characteristics generated
  - Cluster results exported to CSV files with timestamps

## Next Steps

1. **Database Cleanup**:
   - Close all database connections
   - Run the cleanup script to remove temporary and backup tables
   - Verify database size and integrity after cleanup

2. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Review the generated cluster reports
   - Analyze key findings from the clustering
   - Compare results with previous clustering runs

3. **Potential Improvements**:
   - Consider additional feature engineering for better cluster separation
   - Explore alternative clustering algorithms for comparison
   - Implement more advanced outlier detection techniques
