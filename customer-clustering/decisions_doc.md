# Customer Return Clustering - Implementation Decisions and Assumptions

This document outlines key decisions, assumptions, and alternative approaches considered during the implementation of the customer return clustering pipeline.

## Data Processing Decisions

### Email Consolidation Strategy
**Decision Made**: Case-insensitive grouping with Levenshtein distance fallback  
**Rationale**: Balances accuracy with performance for large datasets  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Soundex algorithm: Good for phonetic matching but may over-merge
- Fuzzy matching libraries: More accurate but computationally expensive
- Manual review only: Most accurate but not scalable

**Recommendation**: Monitor consolidation results and adjust similarity thresholds based on false positive rates

### Return Date Data Quality Issues
**Decision Made**: Set return_date = order_date + 1 day for invalid/missing dates  
**Rationale**: Provides consistent temporal features while flagging data quality issues  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Exclude records with invalid dates: Reduces dataset size significantly
- Use order_date as return_date: Creates zero-day returns (unrealistic)
- Impute with median return timing: More complex but potentially more accurate

**Business Impact**: ~X% of records required date correction (see da.ipynb results)

### Customer Eligibility Criteria
**Decision Made**: Include only customers with 50+ order-SKU combinations  
**Rationale**: Ensures sufficient data for reliable pattern recognition  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Lower threshold (20+ orders): More customers but noisier patterns
- Dynamic threshold by tenure: Complex but could improve segment quality
- No threshold: Maximum data but unreliable clustering

## Feature Engineering Decisions

### Consecutive Returns Definition
**Decision Made**: Order-level consecutive returns (any return in order = returned order)  
**Rationale**: Captures customer behavior patterns at transaction level  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Item-level consecutive: More granular but computationally complex
- Time-based consecutive: Calendar periods rather than order sequence
- Weighted by return value: Requires pricing data not yet available

**Implementation Note**: Current approach may underestimate severity for customers who return partial orders

### Seasonal Analysis Scope
**Decision Made**: Only customers with >2 years of history included in seasonal features  
**Rationale**: Ensures meaningful seasonal pattern detection  
**Current Data Impact**: Based on da.ipynb analysis, ~X% of customers qualify  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- 1-year minimum: More customers but less reliable seasonal patterns
- Pro-rated seasonal analysis: Complex normalization required
- External seasonal baselines: Requires market research data

### SKU Adjacency Window
**Decision Made**: ±14 days from current order  
**Rationale**: Balances capturing related purchases with avoiding spurious correlations  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Same order only: Too restrictive for adjacency patterns
- ±30 days: May capture unrelated seasonal effects
- Dynamic window by customer: More accurate but complex to implement

### Category Loyalty Calculation
**Decision Made**: Herfindahl-Hirschman Index approach (sum of squared proportions)  
**Rationale**: Standard concentration measure, interpretable as loyalty score  
**Formula**: Σ(category_purchases_i / total_purchases)²  
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple category count: Doesn't account for purchase distribution
- Entropy-based measure: Less intuitive for business stakeholders
- Gini coefficient: Good alternative but more complex calculation

## Clustering Algorithm Decisions

### Hybrid Approach Rationale
**Decision Made**: DBSCAN → K-means → Sub-DBSCAN pipeline  
**Benefits**:
- DBSCAN identifies outliers and natural density patterns
- K-means provides stable, interpretable main segments
- Sub-DBSCAN refines clusters for personalization

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure K-means: Simpler but doesn't handle outliers well
- Pure DBSCAN: Handles noise well but cluster count varies
- Hierarchical clustering: Good for interpretation but doesn't scale
- Gaussian Mixture Models: Good for overlapping segments but complex parameter tuning

### Feature Scaling Strategy
**Decision Made**: RobustScaler as default  
**Rationale**: Less sensitive to outliers than StandardScaler  
**Alternatives Available**: StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler (configurable)  
**Business Rationale**: Return behavior data often has extreme outliers

### Outlier Detection Threshold
**Decision Made**: 5% contamination rate for Isolation Forest  
**Rationale**: Conservative approach to avoid losing valuable edge cases  
**Tuning Recommendation**: Monitor business value of outlier customers before exclusion

## Technical Implementation Decisions

### Database Layer Architecture
**Decision Made**: Bronze/Silver/Gold data lake pattern  
**Benefits**:
- Bronze: Raw data preservation with minimal transformation
- Silver: Business logic applied, feature engineering complete
- Gold: Analysis-ready, scaled and cleaned

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single table approach: Simpler but less flexible
- Star schema: Good for BI tools but over-engineered for ML pipeline
- Document store: Flexible but adds complexity for structured analysis

### Batch Processing Strategy
**Decision Made**: 50K customer batches for complex features  
**Rationale**: Optimized for 32GB RAM systems while maintaining progress visibility  
**Scaling Considerations**: 
- Increase batch size for more memory
- Decrease for memory-constrained environments
- Implement parallel processing for multi-core optimization

### Missing Value Handling Strategy
**Decision Made**: Feature-type specific imputation  
**Rules**:
- Rates/ratios: Fill with 0.0
- Counts: Fill with 0
- Temporal: Fill with median
- Scores: Fill with median

**Rationale**: Preserves statistical properties while maintaining business logic

## Business Logic Validation Thresholds

### Recommended Warning Thresholds
Based on data analysis (see da.ipynb for statistical justification):

| Feature | Warning Threshold | Rationale |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| return_rate | > 0.95 | Unusually high return behavior |
| avg_days_to_return | > 60 days | Outside typical return window |
| consecutive_returns | > 6 | Potential systematic issues |
| avg_order_size | > 50 items | Potential bulk/business customer |
| sales_qty_mean | > 15 | Unusual quantity patterns |

**Tuning Recommendation**: Adjust thresholds based on business context and seasonal patterns

## Scalability and Performance Decisions

### Database Technology Choice
**Decision Made**: DuckDB for local analytics database  
**Benefits**: Fast analytics, SQL compatibility, embedded deployment  
**Limitations**: Single-node, limited concurrent access  
**Production Considerations**: 
- Scale to PostgreSQL/BigQuery for production
- Implement connection pooling for concurrent access
- Consider columnar storage for large datasets

### Memory Management Strategy
**Decision Made**: Chunked processing with progress logging  
**Implementation**: 50K record chunks for I/O operations  
**Memory Monitoring**: Log peak usage for optimization  
**Scaling Path**: Implement Dask/Ray for out-of-core processing

## Configuration Management

### Clustering Parameters
**Tunability**: All major parameters externalized to configuration  
**Testing Strategy**: A/B test different parameter combinations  
**Business Validation**: Silhouette score balanced with business interpretability

### Data Quality Monitoring
**Automated Checks**: Implemented in pipeline with configurable thresholds  
**Alert Strategy**: Log warnings for review, fail on critical errors  
**Continuous Monitoring**: Track data quality trends over time

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Data Privacy and Security
**Customer Data**: Email addresses hashed in production deployments  
**Retention Policy**: Define data retention periods for clustering analysis  
**Access Control**: Implement role-based access to customer segments

### Model Stability
**Monitoring Strategy**: Track cluster stability over time  
**Retraining Triggers**: Significant data distribution changes  
**Version Control**: Maintain clustering model versions for reproducibility

### Business Continuity
**Fallback Strategies**: Simple rule-based segmentation if clustering fails  
**Validation Framework**: Business stakeholder review of cluster characteristics  
**Gradual Rollout**: A/B test clustering-based interventions before full deployment
