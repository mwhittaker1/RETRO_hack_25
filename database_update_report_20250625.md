# Database Update Report - June 25, 2025

## Overview
This report documents the process of importing the new data file `random1_FINAL_SENT.csv` into the customer clustering database and updating all layers (bronze, silver, and gold).

## Summary of Changes

### Data Import
- Successfully imported `random1_FINAL_SENT.csv` into the bronze layer
- Added 2,437,247 new rows to the bronze layer
- Total rows in bronze layer: 6,072,683 (up from 3,635,436)

### Customer Data
- Unique customers in bronze layer: 15,008 (up from 14,999)
- 9 new customers identified that are not yet in the silver layer
- Notable new customers include email addresses from FP, UO, and Anthropologie domains

### Product Categories
- Unique product categories: 623 (increased significantly)
- Category diversity score calculation updated to use actual category count
- All customers' diversity scores updated in silver and gold layers

### Data Quality
- No duplicates found in any layer after import
- Primary key constraints working as expected
- All column types correctly defined and handled

## Technical Details

### Schema Adjustments
- Modified CSV import to handle all columns as VARCHAR initially
- Used proper type casting for numeric and date fields
- Ensured `units_returned_flag` is consistently handled as VARCHAR

### Pipeline Processing
- Complete pipeline executed in 42.77 seconds
- Silver and gold layers successfully updated
- Exports created with timestamp: `silver_customer_features_20250625_214843.csv` and `gold_cluster_processed_20250625_214843.csv`

### Statistics After Update
- Silver layer category_diversity_score:
  - Min: 0.0
  - Max: 0.33226
  - Avg: 0.05168
  - Std Dev: 0.03737

- Gold layer category_diversity_score_scaled:
  - Min: -1.0
  - Max: 1.0
  - Avg: 0.14965
  - Std Dev: 0.12295

## Recommendations

1. **New Customer Processing**:
   - The 9 new customers in the bronze layer should be fully processed into the silver layer
   - Complete feature engineering needed for these customers

2. **Data Quality Monitoring**:
   - Continue monitoring for duplicates when importing new data
   - Verify schema compatibility before imports
   - Consider implementing more robust type checking for imports

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Re-evaluate feature importance with the expanded dataset
   - Consider if additional features can be derived from the new data

4. **Clustering Model**:
   - Update clustering model with new diversity scores
   - Re-evaluate cluster definitions with the expanded dataset

## Files Generated
- `complete_pipeline_20250625_214843.log`: Detailed log of the import process
- `silver_customer_features_20250625_214843.csv`: Updated silver layer export
- `gold_cluster_processed_20250625_214843.csv`: Updated gold layer export
- `category_diversity_score_distribution.png`: Distribution visualization of diversity scores
- `category_diversity_score_scaled_distribution.png`: Distribution visualization of scaled diversity scores

## Conclusion
The new data has been successfully integrated into all layers of the database. The pipeline correctly handled duplicate detection, schema mapping, and feature updates. The category diversity score calculation has been improved to use the actual number of unique categories in the dataset.

Further analysis is recommended for the new customers, and a comprehensive feature engineering run should be scheduled to process these customers into the silver and gold layers.
