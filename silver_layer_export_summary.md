# Data Layers Export - Summary

## Tasks Completed

1. **Created Export Scripts**
   - Created `export_silver_layer.py` to export the silver layer
   - Created `export_gold_layer.py` to export the gold layer
   - Scripts intelligently choose between Excel (.xlsx) or CSV based on data size
   - Include comprehensive logging for tracking export process

2. **Executed Exports**
   - Successfully exported silver layer to `silver_customer_features_20250625_133058.xlsx`
   - Successfully exported gold layer to `gold_cluster_processed_20250625_134212.xlsx`
   - Both datasets contain 14,999 rows and fit well within Excel's limits
   - Excel format was chosen as the row counts were well below Excel's limit

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added silver layer export information to main README.md
   - Updated customer-clustering/readme_file.md with export steps
   - Updated pipeline architecture diagrams to include export step
